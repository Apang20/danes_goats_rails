<%# I am using in-line style tags. These are gross and clunky, but they work. %>
<div style="text-align:center">
<h1>Check out <%= @person.name%>'s amazing profile!</h1>
<img src=<%=@person.img%> >
<br>
<%= @person.name%> is <%= @person.age%> years old, and currently owns <%= @person.goats.length%> goats! Look how pretty they are!
<br>
<br>

<%# here I just got fancy with a table, but am just iterating through the goats to give info on each one. %>
<table>
<%# @person.goats is an array of goat instances belonging to that person %>
<%@person.goats.each do |g|%>
<%# this defines a new row in the table %>
<tr>
<%# this is one column %>
    <td><img src=<%=g.img%> style="width: 100px">
    </td>
<%# this is the other column. I just included a link_to and some dynamic data rendering %>
    <td><p><%=g.name%> is a <%=g.age%> year old! Want to <%= link_to "visit", goat_path(g) %> her?</p>
    </td>
</tr>
<% end %>
</table>
<br>
Want to <%= link_to "go back", people_path%> and see the rest of the gang?
